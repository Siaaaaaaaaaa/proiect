# SAHAR | Coffee & Social Place

## Project Description
This is a university project which consists of a presentation website for SAHAR, a coffee & social place located in the Cotroceni neighborhood of Bucharest. The project includes three main pages:  

- `index.html` – the main homepage, with a short description of the coffee place and links to the 1st and 2nd page.  
- `pagina1.html` – a page about the history of coffee, including paragraphs, lists, and images.  
- `pagina2.html` – a page about the Cotroceni neighborhood, with paragraphs, images, and a table of points of interest.

All pages include a **header**, a **navigation menu**, and a **footer**. The project is organized into folders by programming language: [CSS](https://github.com/Siaaaaaaaaaa/proiect/tree/main/CSS), [JS](https://github.com/Siaaaaaaaaaa/proiect/tree/main/JS), [PHP](https://github.com/Siaaaaaaaaaa/proiect/tree/main/PHP), and [images](https://github.com/Siaaaaaaaaaa/proiect/tree/main/poze).


## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – for page structure and content.  
- **CSS** – two style schemes (`stil1.css` and `stil2.css`) for layout and color variations.  
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity:  
  - changing the main section’s background color with a button;  
  - displaying a black-and-white version of an image on hover;  
  - adding paragraphs dynamically before and after a table on page 2;  
  - user authentication with pop-up messages.  
- **PHP** – for handling form submissions and saving data (e.g., the Cotroceni survey).

## Features
1. **Navigation menu** across all pages.  
2. **Background change** on page 1 via header button.  
3. **Image hover effect** to switch to black-and-white.  
4. **Dynamic paragraph addition** in page 2 before and after the table.  
5. **User authentication** with local storage and pop-up messages.  
6. **Cotroceni survey** using PHP to send data to the server.

## How to Run
1. Copy the project folder into `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.  
2. Start Apache using XAMPP.  
3. Open the website in a browser at `http://localhost/sahar/index.html`.
